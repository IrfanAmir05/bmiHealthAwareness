	<h2>Benefits of Health Awareness</h2>
	<p>Health awareness allows the community to concentrate on prevention rather than cure, and participation is important to create success in the learning process. Health problems can be significantly reduced if people have awareness of the importance of living a healthy life. This can be achieved through people being knowledgeable about healthy foods and practices that are needed to maintain a healthy body. Family is a powerful basis for generating awareness. If the kids are taught about the healthy foods and their importance from the beginning, the kids, they will be more likely to adopt these practices when they grow up.</p>
